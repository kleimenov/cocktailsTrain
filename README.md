### Description
There is the `Full Stack web application (responsive wepsite)` for cocktails fans.`RESTful API` is an architectural style for this application.
The interface of this application allows user `GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE ` data when the user interacts with APP.

This is cocktails library website. The main idea is to provide a communication platform for the cocktail lovers community, 
sort of a social network where the main discussion object is a cocktail. Users can share their favorite cocktails, left comments, and put likes.

`cocktailsTrain` website has three webpages:
- main (home) page;
- all cocktails page;
- my cocktails page;
- add new cocktail;
- edit existed cocktail;
- delete existed cocktail;
- reviews page.

All pages contain the website header (aka navigation block) with the links to other pages, login and logout buttons. 

1) _The main page_ is the landing page, where you can see a list of all cocktials that consist of all user's personal cocktails. 
Each cocktail has a personal block with a cocktail image (currently this feature under construction and you can see the same placeholder far all cocktails). 
User can click on the cocktail name and get access to the particular cocktail page. All users can see and interact with this page whether registered or not.

2) _The my cocktails page_ is a page that user use so as to hold his favorite cocktails or cocktails that the user wants to share with other users, 
also if the user clicks on each cocktail name on his page, he will be redirected to the specific cocktail page.

3) _Particular cocktail page_ is a page of the specific cocktail. On this page, users can get cocktail information like ingredients. Also on this page implemented three main features, edit cocktail ingredients, delete cocktail, and cocktail's reviews list. 

4) _Edit particular cocktail_ is a page where user can get access to a list of ingredients and add new or update existing ingredients.

5) _Particular cocktail reviews list_ is a page where users can read comments that leavs other users and add new comments. Also on this page implemented the likes feature (I will explain what is that feature further).
